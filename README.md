In the realm of modern science and information technologies, questions related to optimal
traversal have become an integral part of numerous fields. In this context, the exploration of the
traveling salesman problem on outerplanar graphs garners attention as a current and intricate
challenge. Outerplanar graphs constitute an subset of graphs where vertices and edges are
positioned in a manner that they do not intersect in a plane and all vertices belong to the outer
face of the drawing. The traveling salesman problem on such graphs addresses issues of routing,
optimization, and navigation, finding broad applications in domains spanning both mathematics
and computer science, as well as practical scenarios such as route planning in communication
networks and transportation systems. In this article, we will delve into the fundamental aspects
of the traveling salesman problem on outerplanar graphs, scrutinizing existing approaches to
its resolution and investigating their applicability across various contexts.
